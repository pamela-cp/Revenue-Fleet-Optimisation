# Portfolio-Optimization

Mean-Variance | Normalised Semi-Variance | Minimum-Information MV | Rolling Windows

This project implements three portfolio optimisation frameworks using rolling windows:

- MV: Classical Markowitz Mean-Variance
- NSMV: Normalised Semi-Variance (downside-risk aware)
- MIMV: Minimum Information Mean-Variance (robust to estimation error)

The goal is to compare their risk-adjusted performance, stability, and allocation behaviour under realistic constraints.
